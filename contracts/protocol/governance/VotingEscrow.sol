/**
 * @title VotingEscrow
 * @dev VotingEscrow is a non standard ERC20token $veGREEN used to represent the voting power of a user. Users lock $GREEN to obtain $veGREEN. Voting power decreases linearly from the moment of locking.
 * Based on https://github.com/curvefi/curve-dao-contracts/blob/master/doc/README.md
 * Voting weight is equal to w = amount *  t / t_max , so it is dependent on both the locked amount as well as the time locked.
